Not all applications will need the same suite of security features, but any features used will be consistent across applications.&#xD;&#xA;Consistent security interfaces for users: a common user interface to security features will lead to reduced learning time when moving from system to system.&#xD;&#xA;Security independence: application deployment can use the security policy and mechanisms appropriate to the particular environment if there is good layering in the architecture.&#xD;&#xA;A 25% reduction in calls to the help desk relating to security issues.&#xD;&#xA;A 20% reduction in &quot;false positives&quot; detected in the network (a false positive is an event that appears to be an actionable security event, but in fact is a false alarm)."/>
