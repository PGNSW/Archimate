    documentation="Increased rollout of new projects&#xD;&#xA;Decreased time to rollout new projects&#xD;&#xA;Lower cost in rolling out new projects&#xD;&#xA;Decreased loss of service continuity when rolling out new projects&#xD;&#xA;Common development: applications that are common to multiple business areas will be developed or acquired once and re-used rather than separately developed by each business area.&#xD;&#xA;Open systems environment: a standards-based common operating environment, which accommodates the injection of new standards, technologies, and applications on an organization-wide basis, will be established. This standards-based environment will provide the basis for development of common applications and facilitate software re-use.&#xD;&#xA;Use of products: as far as possible, hardware-independent, off-the-shelf items should be used to satisfy requirements in order to reduce dependence on custom developments and to reduce development and maintenance costs.&#xD;&#xA;Software re-use: for those applications that must be custom developed, development of portable applications will reduce the amount of software developed and add to the inventory of software suitable for re-use by other systems.&#xD;&#xA;Resource sharing: data processing resources (hardware, software, and data) will be shared by all users requiring the services of those resources. Resource sharing will be accomplished in the context of security and operational considerations."/>
